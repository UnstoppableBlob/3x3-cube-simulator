## Description

This is an advanced Rubiks Cube Simulator, which lets you rotate the cube with your mouse, lets you click colored buttons for turning the cube's different faces, and has a scramble function.

## How To Use It

You can rotate the cube around to see the different faces by either clicking and dragging the cube, or using the rotate buttons for a more presise rotate. To turn the faces of the cube, there are some colored buttons, all of them labeled by their face, and which direction the turn. If you click those, they will rotate, though you might not see it because of your current view angle.
